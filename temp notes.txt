Spring boot - 

Other end points - 

/auditevents - Audit events for your application 
/beans - List of all beans registered in the spring application context
/mappings - List of all @RequestMapping paths.

there are many more actuator endpoints availabe check spring boot documentation.

By default, only /health is exposed, to exposed all actuator endpoints over HTTP add below wild card property in application.properties file.

#Use wilcard "*" to expose all endpoints.
#Can also expose individual endpoints with a comma-delimited list 
management.endpoints.web.exposure.include =*   // exposing all endppoints using wildcard

Core Java notes - 
 == - checks if elements on both sides of this operator equal or not 

! - not operator - negates what ever the result is.

What is a covariant return type in Java? A covariant return type in Java refers to the ability of a subclass method to override a superclass method and return a more specific type than the return type of the overridden method.

can we overirde static methods in java ?  
NO, we can't override static methods since method overriding relies on dynamic binding at runtime, but static methods are bonded at compile time with static binding. As a result, we are unable to override static methods.

TUF array - 

when array is declared in main method then it is populated with garbage values.

and if array is declared in class as instance variable then int array will be populated as 0 (zero). 

we can declare an array of size 10^6 in main method and in class it is of size 10^7. 


follow brute -> Better -> optimal solution approach.

 First ask interviewer about the test cases then soplve question by brute force and then optimize it and again optimize it.






Arrays.sort( object[] or int[] ) - this works for integer. It is uses TimSort internally. TC - nlogn and n2 in worse case. Quicksort is faster than Timsort and it sorts array inplace so its sppace complexity is O(1). 



Q. left Rotate array by K places.
